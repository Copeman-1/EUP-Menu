üìã Requirements
```
FiveM Server (Cerulean FX or later)
RageUI (menu rendering)
ox_lib (notifications and dialogs)
Discord Bot (for Discord permissions)
```

üêõ Debugging
```
Client Logs: Press F8 for logs (e.g., menu navigation, permissions).

Look for: [EUP_Menu] Permission granted for eup, [EUP_Menu] Opening main menu.


Server Logs: Check for file save/load or Discord API errors.

Look for: [EUP_Menu] Found Discord ID: <id>, [EUP_Menu] Discord roles retrieved: {...}.


Common Issues:

Menu won‚Äôt open:
Ensure RageUI and ox_lib are running (ensure RageUI, ensure ox_lib).
Check client logs for [EUP_Menu] Permission denied for eup.
Verify config.lua is loaded (server log: [EUP_Menu] Config loaded: {...}).


Permission denied:
For Discord: Verify BotToken, GuildID, and role IDs in config.lua.
Ensure bot has Server Members Intent and is in the server.
Check player‚Äôs Discord ID in logs ([EUP_Menu] Found Discord ID: <id>).
For ACE: Add permissions in server.cfg (e.g., add_ace group.admin eup.admin allow).


Discord API errors:
[EUP_Menu] ERROR: Discord API request failed, status: 401: Invalid bot token. Regenerate in Discord Developer Portal.
status: 403: Bot lacks permissions. Re-invite with Guild Members scope.
status: 429: Rate limit hit. Wait a few minutes or add a delay in server.lua.


Uniforms not saving: Check folder permissions and [EUP_Menu] ERROR: Failed to save outfits.json.
```

Add a debug command to server.lua:
```lua
RegisterCommand('testdiscord', function(source)
    local discordID = GetDiscordID(source)
    if discordID then
        GetDiscordRoles(discordID, function(roles)
            print('[EUP_Menu] Test Discord roles: ' .. json.encode(roles))
        end)
    else
        print('[EUP_Menu] Test failed: No Discord ID')
    end
end, false)


Run /testdiscord in-game and check server logs.
```
